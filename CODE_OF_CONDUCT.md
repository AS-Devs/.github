# AS Developers Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the members, contributors, and leaders of AS Developers, pledge to create an inclusive and harassment-free environment for all individuals, regardless of their age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering a community that is open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy.

## Our Standards

To ensure a positive environment in our community, we expect the following behavior from all participants:

* Show empathy and kindness towards others.
* Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Provide and accept constructive feedback gracefully.
* Take responsibility for our mistakes, apologize to those affected, and learn from the experience.
* Focus on the best interests of the community, rather than individual interests.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, and any form of sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments, as well as engaging in personal or political attacks.
* Harassment, whether in public or private.
* Sharing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission.
* Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

AS Developers' community leaders are responsible for enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces within AS Developers. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness any abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [hi@asdevs.dev](mailto:hi@asdevs.dev). All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
